# Online Shopping Cart (python)

## Overview
This project implements a simple **online shopping cart** program in Python.
It demonstrates the use of **object-oriented programming** by defining a class with attributes, a constructor, and a method, then using that class in a main program to process user input and calculate totals.

The program:
1. Defines a class `ItemToPurchase` with attributes for name, price, and quantity.  
2. Prompts the user to enter details for two items.  
3. Prints the cost of each item in the required format.  
4. Outputs the total cost of both items combined.
